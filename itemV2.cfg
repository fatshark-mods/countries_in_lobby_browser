Despair no more!

This mod shows the country code in front of the host's name, so you'll always know whether you should get a good ping or not before joining.

Does not affect quickplay unfortunately - the matchmaking code is a black box managed by Steam with only the dumb and often ineffective distance filters already in use.

You can also filter the lobby list by typing \"/country UK\" (for example) in the chat.
